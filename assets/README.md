- **High Contrast**: Support high contrast mode
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user motion preferences
- **Screen Readers**: Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies

### 3. Responsive Design
- **Multiple Sizes**: Provide assets in various resolutions
- **Vector Graphics**: Use SVG for scalable elements
- **Adaptive Loading**: Load appropriate asset sizes for device
- **Touch Targets**: Ensure adequate size for mobile interaction

### 4. Asset Management
- **Naming Convention**: Use consistent, descriptive file names
- **Organization**: Group related assets logically
- **Version Control**: Track asset changes and updates
- **CDN Integration**: Consider content delivery network for performance
